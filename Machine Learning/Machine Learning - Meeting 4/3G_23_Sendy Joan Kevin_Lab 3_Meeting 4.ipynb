Pada kasus standarisasi ini, nilai yang disimpan adalah *mean* dan *standar deviasi* dari data **X_train**. Jika kita melakukan proses fitting kembali pada **X_test** maka nilai mean dan standar deviasi akan berdasarkan data X_test. Kita tidak ingin itu terjadi, karena model diharapkan mampu melakukan klasifikasi dengan baik pada data yang tidak diketahui (data test). Oleh karena itu, pada X_test hanya dilakukan proses **transform** agar pada saat pembuatan model, model akan menggunakan nilai mean dan standar deviasi yang sama dengan data training."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"wjqjfhsDUwdo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1663923226703,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":579,"user":{"displayName":"SENDY JOAN","userId":"10978887386293311568"}},"outputId":"0f19c4dc-a940-4a8f-8173-6a6f470bd303"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hasil akurasi data training terstandarisasi: 0.8294285714285714\n","Hasil akurasi data testing terstandarisasi: 0.8246666666666667\n"]}],"source":["# Buat obyek GaussianNB lain\n","gnb_std = GaussianNB()\n","\n","# Fit dengan data yang telah di standarisasi\n","gnb_std.fit(X_train_std, y_train)\n","\n","# Prediksi dengan data training\n","y_train_std_pred = gnb_std.predict(X_train_std)\n","\n","# Evaluasi akurasi training data\n","acc_train_std = accuracy_score(y_train, y_train_std_pred)\n","\n","# Prediksi test data yang telah di standarisasi\n","y_test_std_pred = gnb_std.predict(X_test_std)\n","\n","# Evaluasi akurasi testing data\n","acc_test_std = accuracy_score(y_test, y_test_std_pred)\n","\n","# Print hasil evaluasi\n","print(f'Hasil akurasi data training terstandarisasi: {acc_train_std}')\n","print(f'Hasil akurasi data testing terstandarisasi: {acc_test_std}')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Xt_OGr6zUwdo"},"source":["## Kesimpulan\n","\n","Jika diperhatikan, tidak terjadi perubahan yang signifikan antara model dari nilai asli dengan model dengan nilai yang telah di standarisasi, terlebih pada hasil dengan menggunakan data test.
